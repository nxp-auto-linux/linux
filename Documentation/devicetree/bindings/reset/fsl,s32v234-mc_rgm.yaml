description: |
  - The reset generation module (MC_RGM) centralizes the different
  reset sources and manages the reset sequence of the chip. It
  provides a register interface and the reset sequencer. Various
  registers are available to monitor and control the chip reset
  sequence. The reset sequencer is a state machine which controls
  the different phases (PHASE0, PHASE1, PHASE2, PHASE3, and IDLE)
  of the reset sequence and controls the reset signals generated
  in the system.
