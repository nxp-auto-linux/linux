title: LLCE CAN controller on NXP's SoC

description: |
  The Low Latency Communications Engine (LLCE) controls the traditional automotive
  communication interfaces such as CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and SPI.

  There are multiple components involved in LLCE CAN:
    * LLCE firmware
    * LLCE firmware loader
    * LLCE CAN driver which implements SocketCAN interface

  This file will only cover the CAN interface.

  The name of the node must be suffixed with a number which will be used as
  interface id.

  E.g. 'llce_can13' will generate 'llcecan13'. This is used to have an 1:1
       mapping between HW IDs and the interfaces exposed by the driver.

      List of <&phandle type channel>.
      Where 'type' is:
        * S32G274_LLCE_CAN_CONF_MB - Configuration channel
        * S32G274_LLCE_CAN_RX_MB   - RX channel
        * S32G274_LLCE_CAN_TX_MB   - TX channel
      'channel' is a part of the range: [0-15] (max 16 CAN controllers)
      (see mailbox/nxp,s32g274a-llce-mailbox.yaml)
