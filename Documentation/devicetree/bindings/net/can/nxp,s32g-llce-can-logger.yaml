title: LLCE CAN Logger on NXP's ARM based SOCs.

maintainers:
  - Dorin Ionita <dorin.ionita@nxp.com>

description: |
  This driver is used on S32G2xx to log CAN messages received from LLCE.
  It provides a interface to userspace, as a vcan interface.
  Separate LLCE configuration for CAN is expected.
  It assumes that the LLCE Firmware is already loaded.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: nxp,s32g-llce-can-logger

  mboxes:
    description: |
      Must be an array of two mbox channels. The array must have a channel of
      type S32G_LLCE_CAN_LOGGER_CONFIG_MB and the other one of type
      S32G_LLCE_CAN_LOGGER_MB.
      Link to LLCE CAN Logger mailbox.
