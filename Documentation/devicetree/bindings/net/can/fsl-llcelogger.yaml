title: LLCE engine on NXP's ARM based SOCs.

description: |
  This driver is used on S32G2xx to log CAN messages received from LLCE.
  It provides a interface to userspace, as a char device, on which you
  can cat or you can echo a value to set the log size to that dimension.
  Separate LLCE configuration for CAN is expected.
  It assumes that the LLCE Firmware is already loaded.

properties:
  compatible:
    const:
      - fsl,s32g-llcelogger

  reg:
    description: |
      Offset and length of the register set or shared memory regions
      for this device (LLCE HW IP)

  reg-names:
    description: |
      Name for the mapped registers or shared memory regions

  interrupts:
    description: |
      Interrupt tuple for this device - CAN frame processed.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - reg-names
