  A more detailed multi-line description of the binding.

  Details about the hardware device and any links to datasheets can go here.

  Literal blocks are marked with the '|' at the beginning. The end is marked by
  indentation less than the first line of the literal block. Lines also cannot
  begin with a tab character.
