title: S32V234 Shared Memory Block

maintainers:
  - Ionut Vicovan <ionut.vicovan@nxp.com>

description: |
  - This is a shared memory block to be used by various S32V234 generic devices,
    which require a dedicated contiguous memory block to be reserved
    in the kernel memory space.
    It must reside inside the 'reserved-memory' section of the device tree.
    Device is matched via its bus drivers, and has a number of properties
    that apply to the generic device (independent from the bus).
    It may be used by more than one device at once, as long as each one follows
    a proper synchronization mechanism for accessing the data.
