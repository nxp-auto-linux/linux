title: Fault Collection and Control Unit (FCCU) for S32V234 and S32GEN1

maintainers:

description: |
  This module is used to collect and control fault signals from
  peripherals. It requires a correct configuration to enable reception and react
  to a signal from a channel.

  After it is configured successfully, a reset signal from a configured channel can
  reset the system. If a signal is generated before FCCU is configured, the signal
  will be ignored.
