    description: |
      Two integers array, represents a group of pins mux and config
      setting. The format is fsl,pins = <PIN_FUNC_ID CONFIG>
      PIN_FUNC_ID - id of MSCR to be modified
      CONFIG - configuration to be written in the MSCR/IMCR register

      Even though IMCR register should be used as input register, it can be
      set and addressed in the same way as MSCR, only instead of passing the
      IMCR index, IMCR_IDX + 512 is passed.
