	  Driver for CAN interface of the NXP LLCE accelerator. The CAN
	  interface is one of the offloaded communication channels of the
	  Low Latency Communication Engine. The hardware channels abstract
	  the communication that is fully supported through a
	  firmware-defined host interface.

	depends on m
	help
	  This driver is used on S32G2xx to log CAN messages received from LLCE.
	  It provides a interface to userspace, as a char device, on which you
	  can cat or you can echo a value to set the log size to that dimension.
	  Separate LLCE configuration for CAN is expected.

	  It assumes that the LLCE Firmware is already loaded.
